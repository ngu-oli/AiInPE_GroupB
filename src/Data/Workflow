'''What did we do?

Data Cleansing

1. Have a look at Data.
2. Data looks good, but has some Anomalies.
    Every Measurement has Weld-Data, but not evey Measurement has Audio-Data!
    Inspection showed, that on Measurement has a higher Mic-Sensitivity due to a Restart, but no Audio-File available.
    Since there is no Audio, we decided to keep it anyway.

    Weld-Data never has Entries for Wire!
    Interesting: Database says ''No Audio for Measurement 318'', but there is :)
3. To make processing easier, the first 10 rows are dropped

Feature Engineering

1. We decided to compute the mean, std, RMS, min. and max. and fill it into our Database to decide for precise features
2. We handle missing Audiodata by putting in a 0
3. To properly classify, we decided to create the 5 classes: iO, niO - oil, niO - offset, niO - tilt
4. So we need a class to compute features, fill blanks and create class labels

5. In 0001_Database_with_features are the results of this operation
6. With the random forest classifier we found out which feature is the most influential!
7. Plot Screenshot in "Sonstiges"

Model

1. When using Random Forest Classifier you can use the extracted Features to instantly build a model
2. Build Model with the top 6 features
3. Train it, Evaluate it, Print Label

1: niO - Tilt
2: niO - offset
3: niO - oil
